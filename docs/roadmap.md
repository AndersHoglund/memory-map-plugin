# Memory Map utility roadmap

Yes, it didn't say Memory Map _Plugin_ roadmap, because it is our plan to make it an utility that can stand-alone without a Jenkins Plugin.
We will a Jenkins Plugin that uses the utility behind the scenes.

The goal is to move towards are more flexible architecture, with a simple core and some modules to support different visual graphing, output formats and the actual parsing supporting different compilers.
The parsing is supposed to be done using lexical analysis in the future, to support more compilers with less effort.

This is exactly what our blueprint describes. Our blueprint is offered as student assignments, or to interns if they join one of our internships.
